# GDP Per Capita vs. Life Expectancy 

This repo contains my code for an animated graph comparing GDP per capita vs. life expectancy by continent over time. Every continent has its own graph, and each point represents a country within the continent. The points vary in size to indicate varying population sizes. 

The data I used is from the gapminder package in R.
