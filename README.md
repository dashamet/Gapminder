# GDP Per Capita vs. Life Expectancy 

* `gapminder.Rmd` contains my code for an animated graph comparing GDP per capita vs. life expectancy by continent over time. Every continent has its own graph, and each point represents a country within the continent. It produces the HTML file `gapminder.html`. 

* I used data from the R gapminder package.
